MySQL Workbench is a visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. One of its features is the ability to import data into MySQL databases. If you're new to this, this guide will help you through the process of importing data into MySQL using MySQL Workbench.

## Prerequisites:

- MySQL Workbench installed on your computer.

- The data file you want to import (commonly in `.sql`, `.csv`, or `.tsv` formats).

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Launch MySQL Workbench:

1.2. From the welcome screen, connect to your desired MySQL server instance by clicking on its entry under the "MySQL Connections" section.

### 2. Importing `.sql` file:

2.1. Once you've connected to your MySQL server, click on the `Server` menu at the top.

2.2. Select `Data Import` from the dropdown.

2.3. Choose `Import from Self-Contained File` and then click on the browse button (`...`) to locate and select your `.sql` file.

2.4. Under 'Default Target Schema', you can either select an existing schema or create a new one to import your data.

2.5. Click on the `Start Import` button at the bottom right to start the import process.

### 3. Importing `.csv` or `.tsv` file into a Table:

3.1. In the Navigator panel on the left, right-click on the table you want to import data into.
